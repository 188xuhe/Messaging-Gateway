    honhome.com's Privacy Policy




Our Privacy Mission


Honhome.com provides subscribers numerous advanced security and automation services not available anywhere else from a single provider. We are sensitive to the private nature of the information you provide to us. Our Privacy Policy is designed to maximize your ability to protect your personal, private data while at the same time giving you the opportunity to remotely monitor and access your security system. Our mission in implementing this Privacy Policy is to, first, protect your personal information, and second, use it only to provide you with the highest quality services always for your own benefit and exclusively on your behalf. This Privacy Policy states our privacy practices for you, the subscriber, and your use of the www.honhome.com website, our Mobile site or applications, our Voice Portal, and all interactions between you and honhome.com. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.




Information Collection and Use


honhome.com collects and stores information that can be used to uniquely contact, identify, or locate you (“personally identifiable information”) only when you expressly and knowingly provide it. You provide us basic contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. When you subscribe to our services, you provide us your personal preferences (e.g., unit description, sensor names) in order for us to personalize your services.




Location-based Information


Some features of our services, such as location-activated arming reminders and other location-based services (collectively, "GeoServices"), use location information. Before GeoServices information can be used or collected, you must first opt-in to activate these services. If you enable these features, we will automatically collect and store location information from a device you designate which is capable of producing location data (e.g,. mobile device, GPS device, or vehicle). This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited. We also may aggregate this information, but this information will only be used for honhome.com's internal purposes and to provide information requested by you. If you do not wish for us to collect and store this information, do not enable these features.




Information Sharing


honhome.com will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any other entity except:


to your security company (also referred to as your honhome.com Dealer), the company through which you subscribed to our services. Your dealer has the right to use the information only in conformance with their privacy policy, but your dealer has no right to share the information with any third party not directly servicing your account. Accordingly, if you have any concerns about how your dealer will respect your privacy, please refer to their privacy policy before providing us - and therefore them - with any information.
when you have opted in to share the information with the entity.
when we need to share the information with an entity who works on our behalf to provide the services. (These entities do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.)
in response to a legal order, or when honhome.com believes you have acted in violation of your dealer's terms of use or applicable law.
In addition, honhome.com may disclose your information to third party service providers to provide services on behalf of honhome.com when the information has been converted to a form that cannot be used to identify you.




Information Protection


honhome.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your information through a unique username and password, and we protect certain sensitive communications with our website through server authentication and secure connections.




Viewing, Updating, and Deleting Information


You may view, update, or delete your personally identifiable information at any time by following the links at www.honhome.com to your profile and address book pages. These changes will be immediately made to our records. If you wish to stop notifications, you may do so through the website.




Customers of honhome.com Dealers: Changes to your user profile will not affect the records of your dealer. You should contact your dealer directly to make changes to its records.




Cookies and Web Beacons


We employ cookie technology and web beacons to help you move faster through the user interfaces portion of the Service and to analyze how you use our site. A cookie is a string of information sent by a user interface and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. A “web beacon” is an electronic image placed in the code of a web page. Our third party service providers may employ cookies and web beacons to tailor honhome.com's advertising to your interests, monitor the traffic patterns of users from one honhome.com page to another or to improve site performance. We also use cookies to identify you on future visits to our site and to other sites. When you access the honhome.com user interfaces, we place a cookie on your computer. This allows the user interfaces to recognize you as you move through the user interfaces. At your discretion, honhome.com may store and access cookies on your machine to allow you to bypass the process of re-entering your username each time you access the honhome.com website. You can also delete cookies from your website browser at any time.




We may collect information relating to customer trends and patterns and use cookies and software tools to measure site usage and related information. If you are making a purchase from an honhome.com site, we may also use cookies to keep track of the transaction from one web page to another.




We may also permit third parties to place or modify cookies on your computer or mobile device on our behalf. The third parties can use these “tracking cookies” (also known as “third party cookies”) to determine if you have visited certain pages on our site or other sites and may use tracking cookies to present targeted advertisements to you as you visit other sites. These tracking cookies do not contain personally identifiable information (though they do identify the computer or mobile device you use to visit the site) and you can configure your browser to reject tracking cookies.

If you are visiting our Website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to protect your privacy. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
