This Privacy Policy states our privacy practices for you, the subscriber, and your use of the www.honhome.com website, our Mobile site or applications, our Voice Portal, and all interactions between you and honhome.com.

<div><font face="Segoe UI"><BR></font></div>
<div><font face="Segoe UI">honhome.com collects and stores information that can be used to uniquely contact, identify, or locate you (&#8220;personally identifiable information&#8221;) only when you expressly and knowingly provide it. You provide us basic contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. When you subscribe to our services, you provide us your personal preferences (e.g., unit description, sensor names) in order for us to personalize your services.</font></div>

Before GeoServices information can be used or collected, you must first opt-in to activate these services. If you enable these features, we will automatically collect and store location information from a device you designate which is capable of producing location data (e.g,. mobile device, GPS device, or vehicle). This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited. We also may aggregate this information, but this information will only be used for honhome.com's internal purposes and to provide information requested by you. If you do not wish for us to collect and store this information, do not enable these features.</font></div>

A cookie is a string of information sent by a user interface and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. A &#8220;web beacon&#8221; is an electronic image placed in the code of a web page. Our third party service providers may employ cookies and web beacons to tailor honhome.com's advertising to your interests, monitor the traffic patterns of users from one honhome.com page to another or to improve site performance. We also use cookies to identify you on future visits to our site and to other sites. When you access the honhome.com user interfaces, we place a cookie on your computer. This allows the user interfaces to recognize you as you move through the user interfaces. At your discretion, honhome.com may store and access cookies on your machine to allow you to bypass the process of re-entering your username each time you access the honhome.com website. You can also delete cookies from your website browser at any time.</font></div>
